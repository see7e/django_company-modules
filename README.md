# Default Project - Modular Components

Welcome to the Default Project, a versatile enterprise solution comprising various modules designed to meet the needs of a wide range of businesses. These modules are crafted to be generic and adaptable, ensuring compatibility with diverse projects across different industries.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a foundation for building enterprise applications by offering a collection of essential modules. These modules are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to tailor them to specific business requirements without encountering legal constraints or proprietary limitations.

## Key Features

- **Modularity:** The project is structured into distinct modules, each addressing a specific aspect of enterprise functionality. This modular design promotes flexibility and scalability, enabling developers to easily add, remove, or modify modules as needed.

- **Customizability:** The modules are designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to adjust them to suit the unique requirements of their projects. Whether it's fine-tuning configurations or extending functionality, the project provides ample flexibility for customization.

- **Interoperability:** The modules are built to seamlessly integrate with existing systems and technologies, facilitating smooth interoperability with other software components. This interoperability ensures compatibility with a wide range of platforms and frameworks, enhancing the project's versatility and usability.

## Usage

To incorporate the Default Project modules into your enterprise application, simply follow these steps:

1. **Module Selection:** Identify the modules that align with your project requirements. Choose from a diverse range of modules covering areas such as authentication, data management, reporting, and more.

2. **Integration:** Integrate the selected modules into your project by importing them into your codebase. Follow the provided documentation and guidelines to ensure smooth integration and compatibility.

3. **Customization:** Customize the modules as needed to tailor them to your project's specific needs. Adjust configurations, modify functionalities, or extend features to align with your business requirements.

4. **Testing and Deployment:** Thoroughly test the integrated modules to ensure proper functionality and compatibility. Once testing is complete, deploy your enterprise application with confidence, knowing that it's built on a solid foundation of versatile and adaptable modules.


### Deploying on Production

I need to improve the logic for the container to be able to run on production, in the moment it`s only running on development mode.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set environment variable
ENV ENV_ROLE production

# Other Dockerfile instructions...
```

```docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
    web:
        build: .
        environment:
            - ENV_ROLE=production
        # Other service configuration...
```
